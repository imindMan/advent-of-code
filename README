So basically I solved Advent of Code 2023 in 25 programming languages. 

Or another way to say it, one problem one language each.

Note: the solutions are ugly. And I'm not guaranteed that it would work for you, but it worked on my local machine.

I just spinned the wheel of 25 programming languages to pick a random one, and here's the list of the languages used for each day's submission.

Day 1:  Java
Day 2:  C
Day 3:  JavaScript
Day 4:  Go
Day 5:  Python
Day 6:  Lua
Day 7:  Rust
Day 8:  Ruby
Day 9:  TypeScript
Day 10: Crystal
